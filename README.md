AngularJs-Address-Book
======================

Very basic single page address book application for anyone starting with AngularJS. It's the first time ever I've used this framework so probably lots of things can be improved (starting with browser compat). But it's enough to dive into the framework itself and see some of it's good parts.

Requires to be run in server environment.
